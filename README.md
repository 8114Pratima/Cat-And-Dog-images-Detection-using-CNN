Aanlysed 10000 dog and cat images to predict if a dog and cat the type same images.
. Constructed a convolutional neural network with 9 layer using Tensor Flow.
. Trained the model on GPU using TensorFlow-gpu.
. Compared effects of using data augmentation on image data.
.Achieved accuracy of 85 percent on test data set.
